# Simple Image Filters

Created by Aaron Ramirez 2017

## How to use

Simply upload an image using the "Choose Files" button.

Apply various filters, either individually, or stacked on top of each other!

Reset or save your image.

## Updates

Currently fixing save button, until then you have to right click > save in order to save your image.

I also plan to add the ability to remove filters when a filter checkbox is unchecked.

## Feedback
